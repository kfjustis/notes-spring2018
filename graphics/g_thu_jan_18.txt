homework does need a report for first assignment

*submission
-upload pdf of report
-upload a readme on how to build the program (zip of project)

any software is allowed in the final project


slides:

*elements of image formation
-objects
-viewer
-light source(s)

*light
-spectrum
-visible light vs infrared
-wavelength and frequency are inverse

*raytracing and geometric optics
-light bounces off of objects and eventually reaches camera lens

*luminance and color images
-we work with mostly color pictures

*three-color theory
-red, green, blue make up all colors

*additive and subtractive color
-additive color:
  -form a color by adding amounts of primaries
  -primaries are red, green, blue
    -crts and positive film
-subtractive color:
  -form a color by filtering white light with cyan
  -cyan, magenta, and yellow filters
    -often for printing and negative film

*pinhole camera
-formula to calculate the projection of the 3d object

*synthetic camera model

*advantages
-2d graphics is a special case of three dimensions

*why not raytracing?
-it's accurate, but often too slow for realtime
